# 🧮 GUI Calculator (Python)

A simple GUI-based calculator built in Python as a showcase project for basic graphical interface development and event-driven programming.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates how to create a functional calculator using Python with a graphical user interface. It supports basic arithmetic operations and provides an interactive layout that mimics a standard desktop calculator.

The goal of this project is to practice:
- Python GUI development
- Event handling
- Input processing
- Structuring a small standalone application

---

## ✨ Features

- Clean and minimal calculator interface  
- Basic arithmetic operations:
  - Addition (+)
  - Subtraction (−)
  - Multiplication (×)
  - Division (÷)
- Clear/reset functionality  
- Button-based input for easy interaction

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed (3.x recommended).

Check installation:
````bash
python --version
````


Run the Application

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/KazukiNoSuzaku/GUI_Calculator.git

2. Navigate into the project folder:
cd GUI_Calculator

3. Run the calculator:

python Calc.py

# 🧠How It Works
-The GUI is built using Tkinter widgets.
-Buttons trigger functions that update the display.
-User input is captured and evaluated to perform arithmetic operations.
